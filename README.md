# bg_img_changer
A Chrome extension that changes background Image according to URL to image hash.

I created this mainly to set custom backgrounds for my boards at trello.com, a feature available only for premium users. However, this is a simple functionality and can be used at any given url.

Current status:
Initial commit
- Need a popup.html that contains the (page url) -> (image url) hash.
- Need to save the hash
- Need a CRUD for mappings.
